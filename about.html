            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey, I am Harriet Olalekan and I am currently 13 years of age. I am a student of Lead British <br>
            International School, Gwarinpa, Abuja. My favourite subject is Literature-In-English because it <br>
        relates to real life. I love to crochet and sleep. I also read alot depending on my mood because some <br>
        are boring.An advice I will always tell myself is "Fall seven times, rise eight." </p>

            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p>
                HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of most websites. <br>
                 It defines the structure and content of web pages by using tags and elements to tell the browser how to <br>
                  display text, images, and other content. <br>
                 Think of HTML as the skeleton of a web page, providing the basic layout and organization.
